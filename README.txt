Correctly Implemented:
	  1. Background image with repeat
	  2. Audio with autoplay and loop
	  3. Using own id = footer and using to place link

Worked With:
       1. Ann Bellinger and I collaborated on making the most well
       designed CSS and HTML files 

Hours Spent:
       1. Approximately 2 hours, the majority were spent on fixing 
       the footer which still never managed to completely cooperate
